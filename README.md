# Basic Etch-A-Sketch Tool

This page allows you to draw basic designs using a grid of up to 64 x 64 squares. 

In the future, I plan to add a few more features, including:

  - Support for additional color squares
  - A more visual representation of grid size
  - Drawing with clicks rather than mousing over
